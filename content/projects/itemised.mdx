## Introduction

Itemised is a minimalist todo planner designed to provide users with a clean and intuitive interface for managing their tasks. Unlike many todo apps that require user accounts and store data on remote servers, Itemised takes a different approach by storing all data locally on the user's device, ensuring privacy and security without the need for registration. Built using Next.js and TypeScript, Itemised offers a seamless user experience with minimal setup and features.

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Itemised
- **Website**: [Itemised](https://itemised.vercel.app)
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript
- **Development Time**: One week

## Objective
The aim of Itemised was to create a simple yet effective todo planner that stripped away unnecessary complexities commonly found in similar applications. By providing users with a clean UI and eliminating the need for user accounts, Itemised aimed to offer a hassle-free task management experience.

## Features and Functionality
Itemised offers the following key features:

1. **Minimalist UI**: The app boasts a clean and minimalist user interface, focusing on essential task management functionalities without overwhelming users with unnecessary elements.
2. **Accountless**: Users can start using Itemised immediately without the need for registration or account creation. All data is stored locally on the user's device, ensuring privacy and security.
3. **Local Data Storage**: Unlike traditional todo apps that rely on remote servers for data storage, Itemised stores all task data locally on the user's device. This not only enhances privacy but also reduces reliance on external services.

## Technology Choice
Itemised was built using Next.js and TypeScript. While Next.js offers powerful features such as server-side rendering and sophisticated routing, it may be considered overkill for a simple single-page application like Itemised. In hindsight, React and Vite could have been a more suitable choice, given the project's simplicity and the absence of complex routing and server-side rendering requirements.

## Development Process
Itemised was developed over the course of one week, primarily during after-hours outside my job as a developer. The development process involved meticulous planning to ensure the app remained focused on its core objectives of simplicity and usability. Despite the tight timeframe, the project was successfully completed and deployed to production.

## Future Considerations
Moving forward, there are several areas for potential improvement and expansion for Itemised:

1. **Enhanced Mobile Experience**: Optimising the app for mobile devices to ensure a seamless user experience across all screen sizes.

2. **Additional Features**: While Itemised prides itself on its simplicity, there may be opportunities to introduce optional features or customisation options for users seeking additional functionality.

3. **Technology Stack Review**: Re-evaluating the technology stack to ensure it aligns with the project's requirements and constraints, potentially exploring alternative frameworks or libraries for future iterations.

## Conclusion
Itemised exemplifies the power of simplicity in todo planning, offering users a straightforward yet effective tool for managing their tasks without unnecessary complexity. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, the app delivers a seamless user experience while prioritising privacy and security through local data storage. As the project continues to evolve, Itemised remains committed to its core principles of simplicity, usability, and user-centric design.
