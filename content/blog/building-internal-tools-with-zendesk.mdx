## Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of modern business operations, the development of internal tools plays a pivotal role in enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. At Rendr, over the past year, I have been deeply involved in crafting a suite of internal tools tailored to our specific needs. These tools encompass a spectrum of functionalities, from invoice generation to back-office administration, designed to streamline our operational workflows. In this article, I will delve into the intricacies of our approach to building customer service tools at Rendr, with a particular focus on leveraging React and Zendesk for optimal outcomes.

## Background
Rendr stands as a beacon in the realm of software solutions, specializing in the provision of APIs that empower businesses to seamlessly integrate delivery rate calculations into their online stores. Our repertoire extends beyond mere API offerings; we also develop plugins tailored for major eCommerce platforms, facilitating swift adoption even for businesses lacking dedicated development resources. Complementing these services, Rendr furnishes merchants with a comprehensive delivery dashboard UI, empowering them to oversee and manage their delivery operations with unparalleled ease.

Central to Rendr's operations is the intricate orchestration of delivery logistics, wherein data from checkout processes is meticulously analysed to identify the most suitable carrier for each delivery. This entails categorising services into three distinct tiers—Fast, Flexible, and Standard—each tailored to meet diverse delivery requirements. Moreover, we meticulously cater to specific needs such as 'Authority to Leave,' 'Tobacco,' 'Alcohol,' 'Medicine,' 'ID Check,' and more, ensuring a bespoke delivery experience for every customer.

The hallmark of Rendr's service lies in its capacity to offer merchants a singular platform for all their delivery needs, encompassing quoting, booking, and end-to-end management. Additionally, our network-centric approach ensures redundancy, enabling seamless transitions to alternate carriers should contingencies arise. Through this network, we extend our reach across Australia, transcending the limitations of individual carriers.

Given our pivotal role in managing merchants' deliveries, we recognise the paramount importance of providing exemplary customer service, available seven days a week to address any concerns or issues that may arise.

## Identifying the Problem
Despite boasting an exceptional customer service team, equipped with a proactive approach to issue resolution and delivery management, we encountered a significant hurdle. Our team lacked adequate tools to monitor deliveries in real-time and initiate timely interventions when necessary. The absence of such tools impeded our ability to provide proactive support and address issues promptly.

## Proposing a Solution
In January 2023, we embarked on a quest to rectify this deficiency by exploring solutions to equip our customer service team with the requisite tools. Our objective was clear: integrate these tools seamlessly into Zendesk, our chosen ticketing software, thereby facilitating a cohesive workflow for our team members.

## Developing the Solution
Our exploration led us to leverage the extensibility of Zendesk, which allows for the integration of private apps within its ecosystem, including the ticket sidebar, editor, and navigation bar. Leveraging the power of Zendesk's architecture, we initiated a proof of concept with the following guiding principles:

1. **Abstraction Layer**: To ensure flexibility and mitigate potential lock-in, we devised an abstraction layer, enabling us to decouple our solution from the specifics of Zendesk's framework.

2. **API Compatibility**: Given the nascent stage of the project, we opted to integrate our tools seamlessly with existing APIs, deferring the development of proprietary internal APIs for future iterations.

3. **Rapid Prototyping**: With a focus on agility and early feedback, we prioritised the rapid development and deployment of prototypes to gather insights and iterate swiftly.

### App Architecture and Continuous Integration
Our architecture is built upon the principles of modularity and scalability. Leveraging NX, we have adopted a monorepo structure, wherein each Zendesk app resides within the 'apps' directory and shares code with other apps via the 'packages' directory. This approach not only enhances code reuse but also simplifies maintenance and facilitates collaboration across teams.

Additionally, we have embraced Vite as our build tool of choice. To streamline the deployment process, we have developed a bespoke Vite plugin that automatically generates the correct folder structure required to upload the app to Zendesk. This automation significantly reduces manual effort and ensures consistency across deployments.

In our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, we utilise Github Actions to build and test each pull request. Upon merging, another action is triggered to deploy changes to Zendesk using the ZCLI tool. Leveraging NX once again, we selectively build only affected apps and packages, keeping build times minimal and ensuring swift deployment of changes.

### Implementation Details
Our implementation strategy revolves around leveraging TypeScript and React to craft a robust, maintainable solution. We commenced by defining an interface, encapsulating the desired functionality of our platform service. Subsequently, we developed a concrete implementation, seamlessly interfacing with Zendesk's API through the ZAF (Zendesk Application Framework) JavaScript library.

By encapsulating the platform service within a React context provider, we ensured universal accessibility across our application components. This architectural decision facilitated seamless integration with our existing codebase and laid the groundwork for future extensibility.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the successful integration of Zendesk-powered customer service tools stands as a testament to our commitment to excellence at Rendr. By harnessing the synergies between React, TypeScript, Zendesk, and cutting-edge development tools such as NX and Vite, we have equipped our customer service team with the tools they need to deliver exceptional support experiences. Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our pursuit of innovation, continuously refining our internal tools to meet the evolving needs of our dynamic ecosystem.

Through collaboration, innovation, and a relentless dedication to our mission, we are poised to elevate the standard of customer service excellence in the realm of delivery logistics.
